      <p><strong>Contenders: Snakes, Gorillas, & Sharks</strong></p><br>
      <p>The Snakes have a league high 835.46 points scored with the next team (Snarls) a whopping 84.98 points behind.</p><br>
      <p>The tied for 2nd place Gorialls have been winning consistently but this team is one lost away against a good team from being considered "on the bubble".</p><br>
      <p>I'm not convinced yet that the Sharks are actually as good as their 4-2 reord having an early schedule the first 4 games and immediately lost 2 in a row against contenders. Nonetheless, they currently hold the 2nd seed in the playoff bracket and their record is what it is...for now.</p>

      <p><strong>On the Bubble: Snarl's, Bears, Perfect Perrys and Mighty Mikes</strong></p><br>
      <p>There's only room in the playoffs for 4 teams and right noiw neither of these teams have a projected seed but they are good teams (not great) but good enough to give the contenders run for their money.</p><br>
      <p>The next couple weeks will each team a chance to establish themselves and maybe steal a playoff seed.</p>

      <p><strong>Better Luck Next Year: Killers, Mules, Nathan's</strong></p><br>
      <p>It has not been a pretty season for the Killers. If killing a win coumn was a crime the Killers would be the new Mike Myers. Happy Halloween.</p><br>
      <p>The Ugly Ass Mules being tied in record with the Killers have had an ugly season of their own but it's any given sunday. Their sole win comes from defeating the Snarls in week 3.</p><br>
      <p>The Ugly Ass Mules being tied in record with the Killers have had an ugly season of their own but it's any given sunday. Their sole win comes from defeating the Snarls in week 3.</p>
      <p>This team beat the Gorillas (yes the tied for 2nd Gorillas) in week 5 but they only have one game where they had put up more than 120 points. They're a game ahead of the Killers and Mules but a playoff berth is a long shot these little guys.</p>
